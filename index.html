            a bit of audio production, music and art are two things I can't imagine life without.

            In my free time, I play video games and spend time with my wife and our two dogs, I also particularily enjoy 
            writing and playing guitar.

        <h4>Oct 2019 - Now: Gundersen Harmony Care Center - Cook/Dietary Aide</h4>
        <p>In this role I primarily work as a cook, managing one other employee as we work to prepare and serve 
            many different meals. This job involves a lot of problem-solving and communication between departments 
            in order to give the residents the best care possible. On top of this, I have also temporarily stepped 
            into the role of supervisor, and in that role I had much more responsibility in terms of ordering product 
            and managing employees as well as creating schedules.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Jan 2016 - May 2019: Parkway Market & Coffeehouse/Planet Brick - Manager/Order Fulfillment</h4>
        <p>
            This job was very much a multi-faceted role that involved many skills, and I feel as though it taught me 
            so much about not only customer service and managing employees, but about how a business should be run as well.
            The main position I filled was managing the grocery store itself, which also involved preparing many different 
            food items and complicated coffee/tea beverages. I performed stocking, ordering, and much more over time.
            The second aspect of the business was "Planet Brick", a Lego resale store that was run out of the upper floor 
            of the building. My main role withing Planet Brick was fulfilling orders online and shipping them out each day, 
            and in down time I would sort and catalogue different parts and list them for sale on the website.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>July 2013 - November 2015: Jimmy's Pizza - Delivery Driver/Cook/Food Preparation</h4>
        <p>
            My first real job outside of online freelance work, Jimmy's Pizza taught me all about the world 
            of customer service, both the good and the ugly. My day-to-day responsibilities involved preparing and 
            cooking the pizza and other dishes, and then delivering them to within a 20-mile radius from the store.
            This role taught me the importance of time management, as well as how useful technology can be in terms 
            of online maps.
