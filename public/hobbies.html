        <h2>3D Modeling</h2>
        <p>
            I began 3D modeling about fifteen years ago after discover the amazing open-source software <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a>,
            and it has been an off-and-on passion of mine ever since. Though I don't have quite as much time for it as I'd like, 
            it's something I'm always coming back to, always learning about the newest developments and software updates.
            Here are some examples of my work:

            You can find more of my work at <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/tarkata14">TurboSquid</a>, although 
            most of it is quite old by now.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Photography is definitely more of a minor hobby for me, but it is one that I enjoy 
            when the opportunity arises. Here are some examples of my work:
